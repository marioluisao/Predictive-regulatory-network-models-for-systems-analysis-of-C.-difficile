# Predictive-regulatory-network-models-for-systems-analysis-of-C.-difficile
This repository contains an R notebook used for generating the input files for constructing the Environment and Gene Regulatory Influence Network (EGRIN) model for C. difficile. This repository also includes all R code used for analyzing the EGRIN model (i.e., the output of cMonkey2 and the Inferelator tools) and generating the corresponding results and figures reported in the manuscript:
